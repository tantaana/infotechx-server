    "details": "You will start from the ground up by learning how to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (the most widely used CSS framework today) to create modern web pages. Youll then learn how to code your web page so that everything rearranges and resizes automatically according to the size of the users screen, be it a smartphone or a desktop. Youll make your design “responsive” — a must nowadays, since many internet users are on phones. Finally, youll finish the course exploring the most popular language of the web: JavaScript. Using Javascript, youll build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax."

You’ll take a look at the tools you need for coding, such as editors, browsers, and different software tools. You’ll end the week with some HTML5 concepts and the evolution of web design languages. There’s almost no coding in Week 1. The second week is more about code than theory. You’ll understand the Document Object Model (DOM), the tree-like model upon which all websites are built, and learn to use contextual tags and headings in HTML. You’ll also learn about links, images, lists, tables and multimedia to add video or audio to your webpage."

Specifically, this course focuses on four areas: circuit simulation, schematic entry, PCB layout, and 3D CAD modeling. There are many excellent commercial applications available in these areas, however to give everyone access we'll be using all free and open-source software. By the end of this course you should feel comfortable using free and open-source software to design your own printed circuit board and any bracketry or case to hold it, customized for your application"

You will gain experience writing low-level firmware to directly interface hardware with highly efficient, readable and portable design practices. We will now transition from the Host Linux Machine where we built and ran code in a simulated environment to an Integrated Development Environment where you will build and install code directly on your ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller. Course assignments include writing firmware to interact and configure both the underlying ARM architecture and the MSP432 microcontroller platform. The course concludes with a project where you will develop a circular buffer data structure. In this course you will need the Texas Instruments LaunchPad with the MSP432 microcontroller in order to complete the assignments. Later courses of the Specialization will continue to use this hardware tool to develop even more exciting firmware."
